                <ol class="purpose">
                    <li>Marlena woke up ready to take her son to the park but looked outside to see clouds looming in the sky. She grabbed her phone and looked at whereverweather.com to check if it supposed to storm today. Sadly… it was.</li>
                    <li>Marlena’s son came home from school with an assignment focused on learning more about the climate and different unfamiliar terms. Marlena hopped onto whereverweather.com to the additional information page to help him complete the assignment.</li>
                    <li>During work, Jamie was planning an outdoor event in the spring and decided to visit whereverweather.com on her computer to see which weekend had the best weather.</li>
                    <li>Jamie was asked to travel to a different city to help plan an event for a new client so she checked whereverweather.com in order to recommend the perfect date with perfect weather.</li>
                    <li>On event day, Jamie noticed it started sprinkling in the morning. She quickly looked on whereverweather.com to see what time the weather would clear up. Would she have to postpone the event or will the weather turn in her favor?</li>
