            <h3 class="note-titulo">Further Functions</h3>
            <p>Are first-Class object. That means that they can be used the same way as every other value. (accept other functions as parameters and can be return by other functions)</p>
            <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>
            <p>They can have properties and methods for themselves. For example they can use the property <strong>length</strong></p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function square(x) {
                return x*x;
                }  
                square.length
                Output: 1.  
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>I returns how many parameters the function has.</p>
            <h3>Call and Apply Methods</h3>
            <p>The <strong>call()</strong> method is to set the value of this inside the function.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
                   return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;
                }
                    
                sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');
                Output: 'How do you do, my name is Clark'
                    
                sayHello.call(bruce);
                Output: 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>The <strong>apply()</strong> method works the same way, except arguments are pass as an Array.</p>
            <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h3>
            <p><abbr title="Immediately Invoked Function Expressions" >IIFE</abbr> is an anonymous function
            that is invoke as soon as it's define by placing parentheses at the end of the function.</p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                (function(){
                    const temp = 'World';
                    console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
                    })();

                Output= 'Hello World'
                </pre>
            </code>
            <h3>Temporary Variables</h3>
            <p>Placing a temporary variable inside a IIFE will ensure it's only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.
                This process require the use of a temporary variable, called <strong>temp</strong>       </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                let a = 1;
                let b = 2;

                (()=&gt;{
                const temp = a;
                a = b;
                b = temp;
                })();

                a;
                Output= 2

                b;
                Output= 1

                console.log(temp);
                Output= Error: "temp is not defined"
                </pre>
            </code>    

            <p>IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code there'll no need for again. (Note: in ES6 this can be accomplish by jus plicing the 
                code inside a block, this is because variables have block scope</p>
            <h3>Safe use of Strict Mode</h3>
            <p>Safe mode at the begining of a file will enforced strict mode on all the JavaScript file.
                To avoid this, the recommended way is to place all your code inside a IIFE.
            </p>
            <p>IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesnt interfere with any toher part of the program.</p>
            <h3>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h3>
            <p>A function can define itself and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable 
                that has the same name as the function
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function party(){
                    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                    party = function(){
                       console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
                    }
                }    
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>Every time the function is called after the first time, it will log the message 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'.</p>
            <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
            <p>A Recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function factorial(n) {
                    if (n === 0) {
                        return 1;
                        } else {
                            return n * factorial(n - 1);
                        }
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <h3>Callbacks</h3>
            <p>They are function passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>
            <p>They can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. Instead of waiting for an event to accur, a callback can be created
                that's invoked when the event happend. By using callback, we ensure that waiting for these tasks doesnt hold up the execution
                of other parts of the program.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function wait(message, callback, seconds){
                    setTimeout(callback,seconds * 1000);
                    console.log(message);
                }
                function selfDestruct(){
                    console.log('BOOOOM!');
                }
                wait('This tape will self-destruct in five seconds ... ', selfDestruct, 5);
                console.log('Hmmm, should I accept this mission or not ... ?');

                Output= 'This tape will self-destruct in five seconds ... '
                Output= 'Hmmm, should I accept this mission or not ... ? '
                Output= 'BOOOOM!'
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>The increase use of asynchronous programming in JavaScript had made that more and more callback are being used.
                This can result in messy and confusing code. This is when more than one callback is used in the same function. This is called
                <strong>Callbacks Hell.</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Promises</strong> dont do anything that cant already be achieved using callbacks, but the avoid the convoluted code 
            that can result from using multiple callbacks.</p>
            <p>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to be <strong>pending</strong>, and it remains in that state while the operation
            is taking place. It is said that the promise is <i>unsettled</i>. When is completed the promise is said to have been <i>settled</i>.
            A settled promise can result in two different outcomes: Resolved or Rejected.
            </p>
            <p>A promise is created usign a constructor function. This takes a function called an <strong>executor</strong> as an argument.
                The executor initializes the promise and start the asynchronous operation. Also accepts two arguments: the resolve() and the reject().
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
                    // initialization code goes here
                    if (success) {
                        resolve(value);
                    } else {
                        reject(error);
                    }
                });   
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>Once a promise has been settled, the <strong>then()</strong> method can be used to deal with the outcome. This method accept two arguments, resolve and reject.</p>
            <p>If each function that performs an asynchronous operation return a promise, we can chain the <strong>then()</strong> methods. Each promise will only begin once the previous promise has been settled.</p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                login(userName)
                .then(user =&gt; getPlayerInfo(user.id))
                .then(info =&gt; loadGame(info))
                .catch( throw error)   
                </pre>
            </code>
            <h3>Async Functions</h3>
            <p>These functions are preceded by the <strong>async</strong> keyword. This allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.
            This is accomplish by using the <strong>await</strong> operator before an asynchronous function.</p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                async function loadGame(userName) {

                    try {
                        const user = await login(userName);
                        const info = await getPlayerInfo (user.id);
                        // load the game using the returned info
                    }
                    
                    catch (error){
                        throw error;
                    }
                }   
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>Also, functions can return other functions.</p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function returnHello() {
                    console.log('returnHello() called');
                    return function() {
                        console.log('Hello World!');
                    }
                }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <h3>Closures</h3>
            <p>Closure is a reference to a variable what was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function outer() {
                    const outside = 'Outside!';
                    function inner() {
                        const inside = 'Inside!';
                        console.log(outside);
                        console.log(inside);
                    }
                    console.log(outside);
                    inner();
                }   
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>The outer function only has access to the variable outside. The inner function has access to the variable inside 
                but also the variable outside (just from within the outer function)
            </p>
            <p>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any variable declared 
                inside the enclosing function.
            </p>
            <h3>Generators</h3>
            <p>These are used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value. To define a generator function 
                we use the asterisk symbol <strong>(*)</strong> after the function declaration
            </p> 
            <p>Example: funtion* exampleGenerator() {}</p>
            <p>It returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that implements a next() method. that returns a value 
                every time the next() method is called.
            </p>
            <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
            <p>A key aspect of functional Programming is its use of pure functions. Pure function is:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Only depends on the values provided as arguments.</li>
                <li>Doesn't change any values of data elsewhere in the program. Only makes non-destructing data 
                    transformations and return new values </li>
                <li>A pure function always return the same result</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To follow these rules: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least one argument.</li>
                <li>A return value.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example of non-destructive data transformation: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function reverse(string) {
                    return string.split('').reverse().join('');
                }       
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>Using const to declare varibables will help to avoid destructive data transformations.</p>
            <p>The functions performs a series of operations without changing the state of any data.</p>
            <h3>Higher-Order Functions</h3>
            <p>Are function that accept another functions as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both</p>
            <p>Closures are used in higher-order functions.</p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                function multiplier(x){
                    return function(y){
                        return x*y;
                    }
                }    
                </pre>
            </code>
            <h3>Currying</h3>
            <p>Is a process that involves the partial application of functions. A function is said to be curried when not all 
                arguments have been supplied to the function, returns another function that retains the argument already provided. A 
                final result is only returned when all the arguments have been provided
            </p>
            <p>Currying relies on higher-order functions thatt are able to return partially apoplied functions.</p>
            <p>Curring allows you to turn a single function into a series of functions instead.</p>
